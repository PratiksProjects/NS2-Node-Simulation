# NS2-Node-Simulation
An NS2 node simulation used for statistical analysis of different TCP variants. To run just install ns2 and run the command "ns simulation.tcl".
The python and java script files are used for parsing the trace files generated. Some trace files such as the cwnd, throughput with error and no error trace 
files have been included. The nscript bash script is used to run the ns simulation with different error rates and uses the scripts the compute the rates,
which are then stored in a log file.
